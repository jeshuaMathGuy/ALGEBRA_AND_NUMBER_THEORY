        "where v_p denotes p-adic valuation. This formula is a precise manifestation of the algebraic structure of A.\n",

        "  - μ measures \"exponential\" growth in p^n (coming from p-power torsion in Λ-module).\n",

        "  - ν is a constant shift for the particular tower.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) **Interpretation and significance.**\n",
        "  - If μ = 0, the p-part of class numbers grows at most linearly with the layer index n.\n",
        "  - Iwasawa conjectured (and in many cyclotomic cases proved by Ferrero–Washington for abelian extensions of Q)\n",
        "    that μ = 0 for cyclotomic Z_p-extensions of abelian number fields (p odd). For general number fields μ can be > 0.\n",
        "  - λ often relates to the number of Z_p-extensions, the zeroes of p-adic L-functions, and subtle arithmetic invariants.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) **Computational strategy (practical).**\n",
        "  - Direct computation of class groups in high layers quickly becomes infeasible; practical computations are\n",

        "    an algebraic extraction of the invariants by using the growth formula.\n",
        "  - Algebraic rearrangement: Let y_n := v_p(h(K_n)). Define D_n := y_{n+1} - p·y_n. Using the model:\n",
        "        D_n = -λ(p-1) n + (λ + (1-p)ν) .\n",
        "    Hence D_n is affine-linear in n with slope A = -λ(p-1) and intercept B = λ + (1-p)ν. This transformation removes\n",
        "    the μ·p^n leading term and reduces the extraction to a (rational) linear fit for D_n vs n. After recovering λ and ν\n",
        "    (as rational numbers that should be integers if the asymptotic regime is reached), one recovers μ by\n",
        "    μ = (y_n - λ n - ν) / p^n for a large enough n (integer if consistent).\n",
        "  - Important caveat: the formula holds only for sufficiently large n (past the \"stability\" threshold). For small n\n",
        "    additional sporadic factors, local units, ramification effects can make the raw data deviate.\n",
        "\n",
        "(6) **Algorithmic robustness and diagnostics.**\n",
        "  - Use valuation data y_n rather than raw class numbers to avoid overflow and to focus on p-primary behaviour.\n",

        "      lambda = -A/(p-1) should be integer,\n",

        "      mu computed from the largest available n should be an integer.\n",

        "\n",
        "(7) **Extensions and theoretical subtleties.**\n",
        "  - For non-cyclotomic Z_p-extensions, or when A has non-torsion submodules, the simple formula might not hold.\n",
        "  - The \"characteristic power series\" may factor with multiplicities and nontrivial Galois-module structure; descriptions\n",
        "    of λ, μ connect to zeroes of p-adic L-functions (Iwasawa Main Conjecture / theorem in many cases).\n",
        "  - For computational work one should always annotate layers with ramification data, unit ranks, and whether K_n contain p-th roots of unity.\n",

        "(8) **Examples and edge cases.**\n",
        "  - Example: for many abelian fields over Q in cyclotomic towers, μ = 0 (Ferrero-Washington). Then\n",
        "        y_n = λ n + ν\n",
        "    eventually linear, which is easy to detect by looking at first differences y_{n+1}-y_n.\n",
        "  - When data is noisy (small n), the algorithm may give fractional λ or ν; interpret these as \"no stable fit\".\n",
        "\n",
        "(9) **Practical advice.**\n",
        "  - Produce valuations y_n for as many layers as computational resources allow.\n",
        "  - Inspect D_n visually: if D_n is linear for several successive n, you likely are in the stable regime.\n",
        "  - Cross-check by computing mu from different large n and checking consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "(10) **Conclusion.**\n",
        "  The arithmetic content encoded by (μ,λ,ν) summarizes deep arithmetic of the p-adic tower. Algorithmically\n",
